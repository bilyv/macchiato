# Vercel Deployment Guide - 404 Error Fix

## Problem Solved
Fixed the "404: NOT_FOUND" error that occurs when deploying a React SPA (Single Page Application) with client-side routing to Vercel.

## Root Cause
The issue was that Vercel was trying to serve static files directly for routes like `/rooms`, `/admin/dashboard`, etc., instead of serving the `index.html` file and letting React Router handle the client-side routing.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `vercel.json` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Configures Vercel deployment settings
- **Key Features**:
  - Routes all non-static requests to `index.html`
  - Proper caching headers for assets
  - Security headers
  - Static file handling

### 2. `public/_redirects` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Fallback redirect configuration
- **Content**: `/*    /index.html   200`
- **Function**: Ensures all routes redirect to index.html with 200 status

### 3. `vite.config.ts` (MODIFIED)
- **Added**: Build configuration for production
- **Features**:
  - Proper output directory (`dist`)
  - Asset chunking for better performance
  - Optimized build settings

### 4. `package.json` (MODIFIED)
- **Added**: `build:vercel` script
- **Purpose**: Specific build command for Vercel deployment

### 5. `.vercelignore` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Excludes unnecessary files from deployment
- **Benefits**: Faster deployments, smaller bundle size

## How It Works

1. **Build Process**: Vite builds the React app into the `dist` folder
2. **Static Assets**: CSS, JS, and image files are served directly
3. **Route Handling**: All other requests are redirected to `index.html`
4. **Client-Side Routing**: React Router takes over and handles the routing

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Add Vercel configuration for SPA routing"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Connect your repository to Vercel
   - Vercel will automatically detect the configuration
   - Build command: `bun run build` (or `npm run build`)
   - Output directory: `dist`

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Test direct navigation to routes like `/rooms`, `/admin/dashboard`
   - Ensure page refresh works on any route
   - Check that assets load correctly

## Testing Locally

```bash
# Build the project
bun run build

# Preview the production build
bun run preview
```

## Key Configuration Explained

### vercel.json Routes
- `/assets/*` → Serves static assets with long-term caching
- `/robots.txt`, `/placeholder.svg` → Serves static files
- `/*` → All other routes serve `index.html`

### Caching Strategy
- **Assets**: 1 year cache (immutable)
- **Static files**: 1 day cache
- **HTML**: No cache (always fresh)

## Security Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter 404 errors:

1. **Check Build Output**: Ensure `dist/index.html` exists
2. **Verify Routes**: Make sure all routes are defined in React Router
3. **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache and try again
4. **Check Vercel Logs**: Review deployment logs in Vercel dashboard

## Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Vendor and router chunks separated
- **Asset Optimization**: Proper caching headers
- **Gzip Compression**: Enabled by default on Vercel

## Next Steps

After deployment, monitor:
- Page load times
- Route navigation performance
- Any remaining 404 errors in logs

The configuration is now optimized for production deployment on Vercel with proper SPA routing support.
