# Room Form Enhancement Documentation

## Overview
The "Add to Site" room form has been enhanced with a new room lookup functionality that allows users to:
1. Enter a room number
2. Click "Input Room" to fetch existing room details
3. Pre-fill the form with room information (price, capacity, room type)
4. Add additional details like amenities, description, and room image

## New Features

### 1. Room Number Lookup
- **Input Field**: Enter any room number (e.g., 101, 205, etc.)
- **Input Room Button**: Fetches room details from the database
- **Auto-fill**: Automatically populates form fields with existing room data

### 2. Enhanced Form Flow
1. **Step 1**: Enter room number and click "Input Room"
2. **Step 2**: System checks if room exists:
   - **If found**: Loads room details (price, capacity, room type) and shows success message
   - **If not found**: Shows warning message but allows creating new room with that number
3. **Step 3**: Complete additional details:
   - Description (required)
   - Amenities (optional, can add multiple)
   - Room image (optional)
   - Display category (optional)
   - Availability status

### 3. Smart Form Validation
- Form only shows room details section after room number is entered
- Submit button only appears when room number is set
- Button is disabled until required fields are filled:
  - Room type
  - Description  
  - Price per night > 0

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- **Loading States**: Shows spinner while looking up room
- **Success/Error Messages**: Clear feedback for room lookup results
- **Image Preview**: Shows preview of uploaded room image
- **Amenities Management**: Easy add/remove amenities with tags
- **Form Reset**: Automatically resets form after successful creation

## API Enhancements

### New Endpoint
- `GET /api/rooms/number/:roomNumber` - Fetch room by room number

### Backend Changes
- Added `getRoomByNumber` controller function
- Added route for room number lookup
- Enhanced error handling for room not found scenarios

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- **New State Variables**:
  - `roomLookupNumber`: Stores the room number being looked up
  - `isLookingUpRoom`: Loading state for room lookup
  - `roomFound`: Stores found room data
  - `lookupError`: Error message for failed lookups

- **New Functions**:
  - `handleRoomLookup()`: Performs room lookup by number
  - `handleDialogClose()`: Resets form state when dialog closes
